# Interfold

**Where knowledge folds together**

---

## Overview

Interfold is a knowledge management system based on **Manifold theory** and set theory. It allows you to organize information from multiple perspectives simultaneously, without the limitations of traditional hierarchical structures.

## Core Concept

> **Same information, infinite perspectives**

Built on the mathematical concept of manifolds, Interfold treats all information as sets and their intersections. Each piece of knowledge can be viewed from any relevant angle, automatically reorganizing into different tree structures based on your current perspective.

## Key Features

- 🌐 **Multi-perspective views**: Access the same information from different conceptual angles
- 🔄 **Automatic aggregation**: Related content automatically appears in all relevant contexts
- 📊 **Sparse hypergraph model**: Efficient representation of complex knowledge relationships
- 🎯 **Zero cognitive overhead**: Works like a traditional outliner, but with superpowers

## Example

Create once:
```
React > Hooks > Closure
```

Access from multiple perspectives:
- **React perspective**: See Hooks-related content
- **Hooks perspective**: See all Hooks patterns
- **Closure perspective**: See closure concepts across all frameworks

Same information, automatically organized differently based on your viewpoint.

## Status

🚧 Early planning/design phase - no implementation yet

## Documentation

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive design documentation and [naming.md](./naming.md) for naming exploration history.

## Philosophy

Interfold is built on the principle that knowledge is like a manifold - a unified whole that appears different when viewed from different coordinate systems (perspectives). The name "Interfold" captures the folding and unfolding of dimensions as you navigate between these perspectives.
